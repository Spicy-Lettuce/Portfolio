                <!-- About Me -->
                <p>I am Christian Scott, a dedicated student at Kennesaw State University,
                    majoring in Information Technology with a focus on
                    cybersecurity. My academic journey is driven by my interest in
                    protecting digital landscapes from evolving threats, reflecting my
                    commitment to making the online world a safer place. Through my
                    coursework and hands-on projects, I have developed a solid foundation in
                    network security, ethical hacking, and data protection, all of which are
                    preparing me for a successful career in the ever-growing field of
                    cybersecurity.</p>
                <p>Outside the classroom, I am a professional gamer who appreciates the intricate
                    designs and challenges that video games offer. This passion for gaming
                    not only provides a fun escape but also sharpens my problem-solving
                    skills and strategic thinking, both of which are essential in my
                    cybersecurity endeavors.</p>
                <p>My fascination with all things techy extends beyond my academic and
                    recreational activities. I constantly stay updated with the latest
                    technological advancements and enjoy tinkering with new gadgets and
                    software. This continuous curiosity and enthusiasm for technology drives
                    my innovative approach to cybersecurity. Whether it's devising new ways
                    to secure systems or exploring emerging technologies, I am always on the
                    lookout for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, making me a
                    promising talent in the tech industry.</p>
